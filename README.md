RocketUnit is a unit testing framework for ColdFusion. What? I hear you say, Not another one! Well yes, but this one is a bit different:

* It is small - a single CFC.
* It has one assert() function, not tens, but still gives detailed, meaningful messages when assertions fail.

Together, the above features make RocketUnit pretty approachable and easy to use. A few of our clients have been successfully using RocketUnit to test anything from a single custom tag up to a complex payment gateway.
